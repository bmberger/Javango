WHAT I DID WELL: I felt like I did well in recording the user's responses and
displaying those responses back to the user in the e-Receipt.

WHAT I DID WRONG AND SOLVED: I went wrong by forgetting the requirement to use Strings only to get user input.
So, I had to go back to redo data types, add parsing, and etc. 

WHAT I NEED TO IMPROVE ON: I think my only room for improvement is time efficency
on coding substrings and parses.
